```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This repository contains the code implementing the proposed Bayesian mixed-Effects models  for multilevel two-way functional data (BMEF). 


## An illustrating example
Below we demonstrate the use of the proposed method  (`BMEF`)  using simulated data.

First, load the necessary packages and functions:

``` r
source("fun_gen.R")
library(expm)
library(pracma)
library(cmdstanr)
library(bayesplot)
```

We simulate data following the setup in our manuscript, for a case with the following parameters





## 2 settings homogeneous variance and heterogeneous variance

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
